In this project, I've built a tool that tries to predict what might happen to the price of Bitcoin in the future. You know how sometimes you try to guess if it's going to rain or be sunny tomorrow? Well, this is like that, but for Bitcoin prices! It looks at how the price of Bitcoin changed before and uses that information to make a guess about whether it will go up or down. It's pretty cool because it uses a type of smart computer program called machine learning to do the guessing. So, if you're curious about Bitcoin or how computers can make predictions, you'll find this project interesting. Give it a try and see if you can predict Bitcoin's next move!
